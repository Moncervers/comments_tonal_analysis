Смотря на гистограмму, мы видим, что количество комментариев с длинной более 1500 околонулевое, потому удалим их. Еще одной причиной для удаления является то, что BERT способен обрабатывать до 512 токенов, то чуть-чуть больше 1500 символов. В ином случае нам бы пришлось создавать маску размером 5000 символов, что очень сильно увеличило бы время обработки текста и обучения модели. Тем более, что большинство таких комментариев являются просто копипастом одного и того же текста, что не является полезным для обучения модели.",
